## 🧠 AI Prompt: *Help Me Build a Minecraft Modpack Inspired by Satisfactory*

### 📌 **Objective**

I'm building a **Minecraft Forge modpack** inspired by the game **Satisfactory**, focused on *automation*, *logistics*, and *factory-building mechanics*. The modpack will progress through structured phases, mimicking Satisfactory's tier system. Each phase includes modular machines, crafting chains, energy systems, and player tools.

---

### 🛠️ **What You Need to Understand**

1. **Each Phase** corresponds to a **tier** of gameplay.
2. Features are gated by *progression systems* like the HUB and MAM.
3. Some features (like vehicles, fluids, drones, etc.) are *explicitly excluded* to keep the scope focused and avoid overcomplexity.
4. The core of the modpack is **modular machinery**, **power management**, and **item logistics**.
5. The tech tree and unlock system are crucial — no machines should be usable before their phase is unlocked.

### 📦 **Phases & Features (Checklist Format)**

#### 🚀 Phase 1: Core Production & Power Foundation

> Get basic factory systems and crafting mechanics operational.

* [ ] Constructor (2x2 recipes + MAM-unlocked custom recipes)
* [ ] Assembler (3x3 + multi-input recipes, MAM-controlled)
* [ ] Smelter (ore to ingot)
* [ ] Basic Storage Containers
* [ ] Biomass Burner (basic generator)
* [ ] Basic Power Poles & Wires
* [ ] Power Grid System (basic load logic)
* [ ] Manual Hand Mining
* [ ] Item IO API (push/pull to machines)
* [ ] Recipe Locking via MAM

---

#### ⚙️ Phase 2: Item Logistics & Multi-Machine Automation

> Introduce item transport & basic system chaining.

* [ ] Conveyor Belts (Mk1–2)
* [ ] Splitters & Mergers
* [ ] Stackable Conveyors
* [ ] Storage Container IO integration
* [ ] Miners Mk1–Mk3 (placeable on resource nodes)
* [ ] Resource Nodes (pure/normal/impure)
* [ ] Load Balancing / FIFO-style transport logic

---

#### 🔋 Phase 3: Advanced Power & Grid Management

> Build robust energy systems with tiered generation.

* [ ] Coal Generator
* [ ] Overload & Fuse Mechanic (machine shutdown logic)
* [ ] Power Usage GUI (Overlay or Block UI)
* [ ] Power Switches / Breakers
* [ ] Improved Power Pole Tiers
* [ ] Power Graph Tool / Diagnostics

---

#### 🧪 Phase 4: Progression & Tech Unlock Systems

> Integrate MAM, HUB, and Tier/Milestone-based progression.

* [ ] The HUB (central progression block)
* [ ] Milestone Unlock Tree
* [ ] Space Elevator (Tier Gate system)
* [ ] MAM Block with GUI & Tech Tree
* [ ] Research Items / Slug Analysis
* [ ] Recipe Gating System (tied to research/milestones)

---

#### 🧱 Phase 5: Structural & Utility Systems

> Expand factory building capabilities and modularity.

* [ ] Foundations / Build Grid System
* [ ] Zooping Build Tool (multi-place)
* [ ] Factory Lights / Utility Blocks
* [ ] Wall-Mounted Machines (constructors, mergers, etc.)
* [ ] Personal Storage & Equipment Bench
* [ ] Craft Bench Redesign (tiered access)

---

#### 🧭 Phase 6: Player Mobility & World Interaction

> Improve movement, exploration, and interactivity.

* [ ] Hyper Tubes
* [ ] Jump Pads & Blade Runners
* [ ] Resource Scanner Tool
* [ ] Slug Spawning in World
* [ ] Overclocking Mechanic (Power Shards)
* [ ] Map UI / Node Pinning (optional overlay)

---

#### ❌ Phase 7: (Excluded Content)

> The following features are **intentionally omitted**:

* [ ] Pipes / Fluids
* [ ] Refinery / Oil Processing
* [ ] Trucks / Trains / Drones
* [ ] Nuclear Power / Radiation
* [ ] Remote Logistics / Delivery

---

### ✅ Design Guidelines

* Test each phase *in isolation* before moving to the next.
* Prioritize *modular machine logic*, *visual clarity*, and *scalable power/data systems*.
* Tech progression must be *gated* using milestones, HUB, and MAM systems.
* Avoid introducing complex fluid mechanics or vehicles unless required for mod compatibility.

### 🤖 Task for AI

You are to assist in **designing**, **coding**, or **planning** any of the above phases, with the goal of making each feature modular, scalable, and in sync with the intended Satisfactory-like progression.

Start by asking me:

1. Which phase I want to work on.
2. Whether I want help with design, mod integration, or code examples.

Then proceed accordingly.
